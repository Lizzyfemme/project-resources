## Project Resources

I've started collecting some of the boilerplates that I've made or found, along with tutorials and tips gathered by my students.

If you'd like to add a resource, make a pull request with the resources that you're submitting added to the `Boilerplates.json` or `Tutorials.json` files under `src/resources`.

Among the resources that I plan on adding:

- Web RTC
- Chrome Extensions
- Action Cable
- Phaser JS
- Socket IO
- Vue JS
- GraphQL
- Django
- Push notifications (e.g. with Ruby)
- React Router
- Ant Design (and other UI libraries)
- Chart libraries
- Axios, Superagent
- ORMs
- Rails API mode
- JSON Web Tokens
- Automated Testing
