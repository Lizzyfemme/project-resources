This app compiles the user's productivity data (via RescueTIme API), daily activities data, and daily mood data all in a single dashboard. Each day, users are prompted to fill out a \"reflection\" form. The app then uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the text-sentiment behind the user's answers in order to produce a mood score. This app will allow users to enhance their lifestyles by showing users the  correlation between their daily mood, productivity, and activities."
